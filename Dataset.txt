Cryptocurrency Analysis
=======================

I'm going to analyse how the cryptocurrency is evolving over time, how they
interact with each other and maybe even how they interact with the regular
market.

Cryptocurrency is constantly evolving and the exchange is very active. Every
day the market could completely change, which it has done in the past. That is
why I would like to analyse these anomalies and maybe even find a correlation.
But showing the effect of the currency and visualise the possible gains that
could have been made with for example BitCoin is already an interesting process

The dataset I plan on using can be found at:
