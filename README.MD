# Portfolio for the Data Visualisation course by Rick Rongen
## Summary
Data Visualisation is an subject in the Applied Data Science minor of the Fontys University of ICT.

Visualisation is important part of data science, since you just can't give someone a table and expect them to understand what is going on.
By visualising the data in graphs etc. people will see what is going on and actually understand the data.
